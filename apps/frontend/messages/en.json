    "faq1Question": "What is Public API Navigator?",
    "faq1Answer": "Public API Navigator is a production-grade directory that syncs with the public-apis repository, adds real-time health monitoring, and provides structured metadata to help developers discover and evaluate public APIs without guesswork.",
    "faq2Question": "How do I use this platform?",
    "faq2Answer": "Browse the catalog, use filters to narrow down APIs by category, authentication type, CORS support, or health status. Click any API to view detailed information, health metrics, and interactive documentation.",
    "faq3Question": "Are all APIs free to use?",
    "faq3Answer": "Most APIs in the catalog are free for basic usage, but each provider sets their own terms. Check the individual API documentation for pricing, rate limits, and authentication requirements before integration.",
    "faq4Question": "How does health monitoring work?",
    "faq4Answer": "ApiNavigatorBot performs hourly health checks on API homepages (not endpoints) with SSRF guards and rate limiting. Status pills show real-time availability: green (online), yellow (slow), red (down), or gray (not checked).",
    "faq5Question": "What authentication types are supported?",
    "faq5Answer": "APIs support various auth methods including No Auth, API Key, OAuth, JWT, and more. Use the auth filter to find APIs that match your security requirements. Each API page displays the specific auth type needed.",
    "faq6Question": "Can I add my API to the catalog?",
    "faq6Answer": "This platform syncs with the public-apis/public-apis GitHub repository. To add your API, submit a pull request to that repository following their contribution guidelines. Your API will appear here after the next sync.",
    "faq7Question": "What does CORS support mean?",
    "faq7Answer": "CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) determines if you can call the API directly from browser JavaScript. 'Yes' means browser-friendly; 'No' or 'Unknown' means you need a backend proxy to avoid CORS errors.",
    "faq8Question": "How fresh is the data?",
    "faq8Answer": "The catalog syncs with the upstream repository regularly. Health checks run hourly with timestamps visible on each API page. The 'Last Checked' field shows exactly how recent the status information is.",
